# Tweet-profanity-checker
This is a Python program that reads tweets from a file and calculates the degree of profanity for each tweet based on a set of racial slurs.

# Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have latest version of Python or PyCharm installed on your system. You can also use google colab.

# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Replace tweets1.txt with the file path of the file containing tweets that you want to analyze.
Replace the set of racial_slurs with the actual set of words that indicate racial slurs that you want to detect.
Run the program using a Python interpreter or an IDE.
The program will calculate the degree of profanity for each tweet and print the results to the console.

# Customization
You can customize this program to suit your specific needs, such as:

Reading tweets from a different source, such as a database or an API.
Using a different set of racial slurs.
Writing the results to a file instead of printing them to the console.
To make these customizations, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
